## stacked diffs/cascading rebasing
a tool for myself. tldr if you have a stack of branches/changes: a, b, c, d, .... a change on b would require rebasing c onto b, d onto c, etc. this script just automates that and provides a stack description for every pr in the stack.


these should've been a collection of bash scripts (i dont know bash)
